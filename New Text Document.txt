What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.


Python Variable

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

input() to take inputs
print() to print outputs


Data types

numeric types (int, float, complex), string (str), boolean (bool), and collection types (list, tuple, dict, set)

Operators
Operators refer to special symbols that perform operations on values and variables

Arithmetic Operator
+
-
*
/
%
**
Assignment Operator
=
+=
-=


Comparison operators
==
!=
<=
>=

logical Operator
and
or
not

Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).


Python Functions
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.

List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)


Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)





Global and local variable

Python Global variables are those which are not defined inside any function and have a global scope.
Python local variables are those which are defined inside a function and their scope is limited to that function only.

def f():
    s= "I am local variable"
    print("Inside Function", s)

 
# Global scope
s = "I am global variable"
f()
print("Outside Function", s)



Python Classes/Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)


Python Inheritance
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.


Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()


Absolute and relative file paths
Absolute paths always start with the root directory and provide the full path to the file or directory.
Relative path is a path to a file or directory that is relative to the current directory.

What is CSV data in Python?
CSV is an acronym for comma-separated values. It's a file format that you can use to store tabular data, such as in a spreadsheet. 
You can also use it to store data from a tabular database. You can refer to each row in a CSV file as a data record.
Each data record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.

TKINTER
Tkinter is a Python library that can be used to construct basic graphical user interface (GUI) applications. 
In Python, it is the most widely used module for GUI applications.

What are args and kwargs in Python?
The args stands for arguments that are passed to the function .
kwargs stands for keyword arguments which are passed along with the values into the function.

We use *args and **kwargs as an argument when we are unsure about the number of arguments to pass in the functions.




Python Try Except

try:
  print("Hello")
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
else:
  print("Nothing went wrong")
finally:
  print("The 'try except' is finished")

The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.

The except block lets you handle the error.

The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.

The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

API
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a server that you can use to retrieve and send data to using code. APIs are most commonly used to retrieve data
