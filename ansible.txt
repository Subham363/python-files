Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment, intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools.

Ansible is easy to deploy because it does not use any agents or custom security infrastructure.


Playbooks are the files where Ansible code is written. Playbooks are written in YAML format. 
YAML stands for Yet Another Markup Language. Playbooks are one of the core features of Ansible and tell Ansible what to execute. 
They are like a to-do list for Ansible that contains a list of tasks.


YAML uses simple key-value pair to represent the data. The dictionary is represented in key: value pair.


Example: A student record
--- #Optional YAML start syntax 
james: 
   name: james john 
   rollNo: 34 
   div: B 
   sex: male 
â€¦ #Optional YAML end syntax 


Roles provide a framework for fully independent, or interdependent collections of variables, tasks, files, templates, and modules.
